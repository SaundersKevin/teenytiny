# teenytiny

This is my own Haskell implimentation of [Austin Henley's Teeny Tiny Compiler](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html)

Currently the project is unfinished -- the Emitter needs to be fleshed out.
Another hope is to add more explicit error messages.

Teeny Tiny is based on BASIC, though with a very small amount of keywords. This allows it to be created very easily, and is a really fun way to start learning about compilers!

This compiler uses C as it's target.
